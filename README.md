# Placement Prediction Project 🎓📊

## 📌 Project Overview
The **Placement Prediction Project** is a machine learning application that predicts whether a student is likely to be placed based on their academic performance and other relevant factors.  
This project uses **Logistic Regression** to perform binary classification (Placed / Not Placed).

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement
Many students are unsure about their placement chances based on their academic profile.  
This project aims to provide an early prediction that can help students understand their placement probability and focus on improvement areas.

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Approach
- Algorithm Used: **Logistic Regression**
- Type: **Supervised Learning**
- Task: **Binary Classification**

---

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains student-related features such as:
- CGPA  
- IQ  
- Academic performance indicators  

(Target variable: **Placement Status**)

---

## ⚙️ Technologies & Tools Used
- Python 🐍  
- NumPy  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib / Seaborn  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## 🚀 How the Project Works
1. Load and preprocess the dataset  
2. Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)  
3. Train Logistic Regression model  
4. Evaluate model performance  
5. Predict placement outcome for new inputs  

---

## 📊 Model Output
The model predicts:
- **1 → Placed**
- **0 → Not Placed**

---

## ✅ Results
The Logistic Regression model provides a reasonable accuracy for predicting placement status based on academic attributes.

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements
- Add more features (skills, internships, projects)
- Try advanced models (Random Forest, SVM)
- Deploy using Streamlit or Flask
- Improve accuracy with hyperparameter tuning
